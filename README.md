# ML Repository
This repository was created for studying machine learning concepts and experimenting with different methods for training models.

## 1. `analityc.py`
This file contains code for **analytic weight calculation** for a model.  
It visualizes predictions and targets:  
- **Blue points** – predictions  
- **Red points (or line)** – targets

## 2. `grad.py` and `Batch.py`
These files contain code for **gradient descent** methods to search for model weights:  
- `grad.py` – standard gradient descent  
- `Batch.py` – batch gradient descent  

## 3. `classification.py`
Binary classification implementation.

## 4. `multiclassification.py`
Multi-class classification implementation.
